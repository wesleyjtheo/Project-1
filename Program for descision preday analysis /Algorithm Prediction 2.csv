#,Volume Daily,Volume Avg,VA Placement,VA Width,Performance Strength,Detailed Comments,Expected Results & Trading Strategy
"1,H,H,Hi,W,VERY STRONG UP,""Extremely bullish - high volume both daily and vs average, value accepted higher, and wide distribution shows strong agreement.  This is textbook buyer dominance with conviction. Market facilitated trade at higher prices with broad participation. "",""CONTINUATION HIGHER EXPECTED - Strong uptrend with participation.  Buyers in full control. Enter long on any pullback to value area.  Sellers should cover shorts and stand aside.  High confidence for continued strength."""
"2,H,H,Hi,A,STRONG UP,""Strong bullish setup - high volume confirming buyer conviction, value area moved higher with average width showing normal acceptance. Good follow-through likely. Volume confirms the higher value placement. "",""HIGHER EXPECTED - Solid upward momentum. Look to enter long on dips. Average VA width suggests normal trending. Sellers should not fight this. Moderate-high confidence for continuation."""
"3,H,H,Hi,N,STRONG UP (TRENDING),""High volume with value higher but narrow - this is trending behavior. Narrow VA with high volume means directional conviction, not sideways acceptance. Strong initiative buying pushing through price levels quickly."",""TRENDING HIGHER EXPECTED - Narrow VA with high volume = trend day continuation. Enter long aggressively. Don't wait for deep pullbacks. Sellers stay flat. This is strong directional movement.  High confidence."""
"4,H,H,OH,W,MODERATELY STRONG UP,""High volume but value area overlapping high suggests some resistance or taking of profits. Wide VA shows good participation but not complete breakout.  Mixed conviction at upper levels."",""LIKELY HIGHER BUT WATCH - Good volume but overlapping VA suggests consolidation at highs possible. Enter long but watch for resistance. Wider VA could mean distribution forming. Moderate confidence."""

Low confidence - wait."""
"9,B,B,S,B,+2,HIGHER,""BUYER PREVAILS DESPITE TOP TAIL - Interesting dynamic:  buyers controlled rotation and extended range up, composite shows classic buyer structure (low open, moved up), BUT there's a top tail indicating higher prices were rejected. This suggests buyers pushed aggressively but met resistance at highs. However, the overall structure still favors buyers 3-1.  Moderate confidence for higher, but watch for resistance.  Buyers in control but hitting ceiling."""
