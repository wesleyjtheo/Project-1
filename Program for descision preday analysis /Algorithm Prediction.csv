#,Rotation,Range Extension,Tails,Composite,Score,Direction,Detailed Comments & Market Analysis
"1,B,B,B,B,+4,HIGHER,""MAXIMUM BUYER CONVICTION - All four factors aligned perfectly. Rotation shows buyers in control, range extended up confirming initiative buying, bottom tail proves sellers tested lower but failed (rejection), and composite opened low and moved up showing strong buyer response. This is textbook buyer dominance.  Next day should attempt to auction higher with high confidence.  Look for continuation or short covering rally."""
"2,B,B,B,N,+3,HIGHER,""STRONG BUYER DAY - Three critical factors show buyer control.  Positive rotation indicates buyers winning time-price opportunities, upward extension shows initiative buyers expanding value, bottom tail confirms lower prices were rejected.  Neutral composite (opened mid-range) doesn't contradict the buyer narrative. High confidence for higher auction attempt. Market showing clear directional conviction despite mid-range open."""
"3,B,B,B,S,+2,HIGHER,""BUYER DOMINANT WITH CAVEAT - Strong buyer signals in rotation, extension, and tail, but composite shows opened high and moved down (seller characteristic). This suggests early weakness that was overcome by aggressive buyers. The fact that buyers still extended range up AND left bottom tail despite poor composite structure shows strong underlying demand. Buyer conviction outweighs the composite conflict. Moderate-high confidence for higher attempt."""
"4,B,B,B,X,+3,HIGHER,""STRONG BUYER CONVICTION - Three solid buyer factors with N/A composite (extremely wide range day makes composite analysis impossible). Positive rotation shows time favored buyers, upward extension confirms initiative, bottom tail shows seller failure.  The absence of composite data doesn't weaken the case - three aligned factors provide high confidence. Expect higher auction attempt, possibly trending day continuation."""
"5,B,B,N,B,+3,HIGHER,""STRONG BUYER CONTROL - Rotation positive, extension up, composite bullish (opened low, moved up). The neutral tail (both ends or neither) doesn't negate three strong buyer signals. This pattern suggests market is in discovery mode moving higher - both tails indicate two-sided acceptance at new levels or a balanced profile while trending.  High confidence for continuation higher."""
"6,B,B,N,N,+2,HIGHER,""BUYER IN CONTROL, MODERATE STRENGTH - Rotation and extension both favor buyers, showing time and initiative on buyer side. Neutral tail and neutral composite suggest mid-range activity without extreme testing. This is a steady buyer day without dramatic rejection - think gradual accumulation. Moderate confidence for higher attempt, though less explosive than when all factors align.  Watch for continuation vs. consolidation."""
"7,B,B,N,S,+1,NEUTRAL,""MIXED SIGNALS - SLIGHT BUYER EDGE - Buyer rotation and extension conflict with seller composite (opened high, moved down). Neutral tail adds no clarity. This suggests market opened with seller advantage, but buyers took control during the session to extend range up. The battle is real here.  While buyers won the day, the poor composite structure and lack of clear tail rejection make next-day direction uncertain. Expect balancing or cautious continuation."""
"8,B,B,N,X,+2,HIGHER,""BUYER SHOWING STRENGTH - Positive rotation and upward extension both confirm buyer initiative.  Neutral tail suggests no extreme testing/rejection. N/A composite removes one variable but doesn't weaken the case. Two solid buyer factors indicate momentum. Moderate confidence for higher auction attempt.  Market likely in trending mode with wide range preventing composite analysis."""
"9,B,B,S,B,+2,HIGHER,""BUYER PREVAILS DESPITE TOP TAIL - Interesting dynamic:  buyers controlled rotation and extended range up, composite shows classic buyer structure (low open, moved up), BUT there's a top tail indicating higher prices were rejected. This suggests buyers pushed aggressively but met resistance at highs. However, the overall structure still favors buyers 3-1.  Moderate confidence for higher, but watch for resistance.  Buyers in control but hitting ceiling."""
"10,B,B,S,N,+1,NEUTRAL,""BALANCED WITH COMPLICATIONS - Buyer rotation and extension conflict with seller tail (top rejection). Neutral composite provides no tie-breaker. This pattern shows buyers attempted higher (extension confirms), controlled time (rotation), but failed at upper extreme (tail rejection). Mixed message:  initiative was buyer-driven, but outcome shows resistance. Expect balancing day or choppy action as market digests the failed breakout attempt."""
"11,B,B,S,S,0,NEUTRAL,""PERFECTLY CONFLICTED - Two buyer factors (rotation, extension) vs. two seller factors (tail, composite). Rotation and extension say buyers controlled session and pushed higher.  But top tail shows rejection at highs, and seller composite (opened high, moved down) indicates underlying weakness. This is a bull trap pattern - looks bullish but has bearish undertones. Low confidence either direction.  Expect balancing day as market sorts out the conflict."""
"12,B,B,S,X,+1,NEUTRAL,""SLIGHT BUYER EDGE WITH WARNING - Buyer rotation and extension are positive, but top tail shows rejection at highs. Wide-range N/A composite removes clarity. While buyers controlled time and expanded range up, the failure at highs (tail) is concerning. This suggests buyers tried but couldn't sustain upper levels. Low-moderate confidence.  Could go either way - monitor for follow-through or reversal."""
"13,B,N,B,B,+3,HIGHER,""STRONG BUYER CONVICTION - Positive rotation, bottom tail rejection, and buyer composite all aligned. No range extension suggests contained activity, but within that range, buyers clearly dominated. Bottom tail proves sellers tried lower and failed.  Composite confirms responsive buyers lifted market from lows. This is controlled buyer accumulation.  High confidence for higher attempt. Classic responsive buyer day that should lead to initiative buying next session."""
"14,B,N,B,N,+2,HIGHER,""BUYER CONTROL, MODERATE CONFIDENCE - Positive rotation and bottom tail both favor buyers.  No range extension (contained day) and neutral composite suggest methodical rather than aggressive buying. Bottom tail rejection is key - sellers failed.  Rotation confirms time favored buyers. Moderate confidence for higher.  Not explosive, but steady buyer presence should lead to continuation."""
"15,B,N,B,S,+1,NEUTRAL,""CONFLICTING STORY - Buyer rotation and bottom tail (rejection of lows) conflict with seller composite (opened high, moved down). No extension adds to the contained nature.  This suggests market opened with control at highs (sellers), buyers defended lows aggressively (tail), and controlled time (rotation), but couldn't overcome the poor open.  Mixed conviction.  Expect balancing as neither side dominated completely."""
"16,B,N,B,X,+2,HIGHER,""BUYER SIGNALS PRESENT - Positive rotation and bottom tail with N/A composite. No range extension suggests range-bound activity.  However, within that range, buyers controlled time and sellers failed at lows (tail rejection). Two solid factors without contradiction. Moderate confidence for higher auction attempt.  Steady rather than explosive."""
"17,B,N,N,B,+2,HIGHER,""QUIET BUYER ACCUMULATION - Positive rotation and buyer composite (opened low, moved up) with no extensions or meaningful tails. This is classic responsive buyer day - no dramatic action, but clear buyer control. Opened weak, closed strong, time favored buyers. Moderate confidence for continuation.  Not flashy, but effective buyer day that often precedes larger moves."""
"18,B,N,N,N,+1,NEUTRAL,""WEAK BUYER SIGNAL - Only positive rotation favors buyers.  No extension, no meaningful tails, neutral composite.  This suggests buyers controlled time slightly but couldn't create any structural advantage. Very low conviction day. Expect balancing or continuation of whatever trend preceded this.  Not enough evidence for directional call."""
"19,B,N,N,S,0,NEUTRAL,""ROTATION VS COMPOSITE STANDOFF - Positive rotation (buyers controlled time) directly conflicts with seller composite (opened high, moved down). No extensions or tails to break the tie. This is a contained range day where buyers won time but sellers held structural advantage. Perfectly balanced. Expect balancing day as market resolves this internal conflict.  No edge either direction."""
"20,B,N,N,X,+1,NEUTRAL,""MINIMAL BUYER EDGE - Only positive rotation with everything else neutral or N/A.  Extremely weak signal. While buyers marginally controlled time allocation, there's no structural confirmation via extension, tail, or composite. Very low confidence. This is essentially a do-nothing day.  Expect continued consolidation or very tentative movement."""
"21,B,N,S,B,+1,NEUTRAL,""INTERNAL CONFLICT - Positive rotation and buyer composite vs. top tail rejection. No extension.  The buyer composite (low open, moved up) and positive rotation suggest buyer strength, but the top tail shows they failed at highs.  This is buyers trying but meeting resistance.  Low confidence. Could consolidate or pullback to digest the failed high test."""
"22,B,N,S,N,0,NEUTRAL,""PERFECT BALANCE - Positive rotation (buyer) vs. top tail (seller rejection) with neutral extension and composite. One factor each direction. No clear winner.

Low conviction for lower, but sellers have edge. Possible balancing with downside bias."""
"24,B,N,S,X,0,NEUTRAL,""ROTATION VS TAIL - Positive rotation (buyers controlled time) vs. top tail (rejection of highs). N/A composite and no extension.

"25,B,S,B,B,+2,HIGHER,""BUYER RESILIENCE - Positive rotation, bottom tail, and buyer composite all favor buyers, but range extended DOWN (seller characteristic). This unusual pattern suggests sellers tried to push lower (extension), but buyers aggressively defended (bottom tail rejection), controlled time (rotation), and lifted from lows (composite). Sellers failed despite initiative.  Buyer response was stronger than seller initiative.  Moderate-high confidence for higher - buyers proved their conviction."""
"26,B,S,B,N,+1,NEUTRAL,""MIXED SIGNALS - Positive rotation and bottom tail favor buyers, but downward extension favors sellers.  Neutral composite adds no clarity.
